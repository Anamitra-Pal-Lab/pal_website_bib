  abstract = {Phasor measurement units (PMUs) provide a high-resolution view of the power system at the locations where they are placed. As such, it is desirable to place them in bulk in low voltage distribution circuits. However, the power consumption of a PMU /micro-PMU is in the order of Watts (W) that results in them requiring an external power supply, which in turn increases the overall cost. This work details the hardware design of a PMU capable of measuring and reporting voltage and current phasors for a single-phase system at an average power consumption of only 30.8 mW- one to two orders of magnitude lower than existing academic and commercial PMUs. This enables the proposed PMU to run for two weeks using an 11-Wh battery or indefinitely if paired with an inexpensive solar panel. A test-bench developed in accordance with the 2018 IECI/EEE 60255-118-1 PMU Standard confirms the accuracy of this PMU. Given its low power consumption, the proposed design is expected to accelerate adoption of PMUs in modern distribution grids.},

Firstly, the linearized state space model of the PMSG-integrated power system is established. Secondly, a polytopic LPV system is developed to account for the stochastic drift behavior and wind speed variability. Next, a gap metric-based nonlinearity measurement method is used for configuring the vertices of the polytope. The adaptive polytopic LPV controller is solved using linear matrix inequality and gain scheduling control theory, while mode identification based on a sliding window fast Fourier transform is employed for adaptively adjusting the polytopic LPV controller. Finally, the proposed polytopic LPV adaptive control scheme is compared with three other control techniques to demonstrate its effectiveness in suppressing SSOs. }

Traditional approaches for security assessment are often limited by their scope and/or speed, resulting in missing of critical contingencies that could lead to cascading failures. This paper proposes a two-component methodology to enhance power system security. The first component combines an efficient algorithm to detect cut-set saturation (called the feasibility test (FT) algorithm) with real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) to create an integrated corrective action (iCA), whose goal is to secure the system against cut-set saturation as well as critical branch overloads. The second component only employs the results of the FT to create a relaxed corrective action (rCA) to secure the system against post-contingency cut-set saturation. The first component is more comprehensive, but the latter is computationally more efficient. The effectiveness of the two components is evaluated based upon the number of cascade triggering contingencies alleviated, and the computation time. The results obtained by analyzing different case-studies on the IEEE 118-bus and 2000-bus synthetic Texas systems indicate that the proposed two-component methodology successfully enhances the scope and speed of power system security assessment during multiple outages},

Undesirable components, such as decaying DC, if present in the input signal, are first attenuated using a complex-gain filter. The initial estimates of phasor and frequency are obtained next using the discrete Fourier transform and an improved estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique, respectively. Finally, the accuracy of phasor and frequency estimates are increased based on the identified system condition. Simulations performed to evaluate the proposed approach confirm that it can do fast and accurate estimation of phasor and frequency under diverse operating conditions, making it ideal for wide-area monitoring, protection, and control applications in power systems.},

	abstract = {Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) are essential devices used for the efficient performance of modern power systems and many developing countries lack these devices. Due to the non-existence of these advanced technologies, the national grid remains weak and vulnerable to power stability issues that can jeopardize system stability. This study proposes novel research to solve issues of an evolving national grid through the installation of FACTS devices. FACTS devices play a crucial role in minimizing active power losses while managing reactive power flows to keep the voltages within their respective limits. Due to the high costs of FACTS, optimization must be done to discover optimal locations as well as ratings of these devices. However, due to the nonlinearity, it is a challenging task to find the optimal locations and appropriate sizes of these devices. Shunt VARs Compensators (SVCs) and Thyristor-Controlled Series Compensators (TCSCs) are the two FACTS devices considered for the study. Optimal locations for SVCs and TCSCs are determined by Voltage Collapse Proximity Index (VCPI) and Line Stability Index (Lmn), respectively. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to find the ideal rating for FACTS devices to minimize the system operating cost (cost due to active power loss and capital cost of FACTS devices). This technique is applied to IEEE (14 and 30) bus systems. Moreover, reliable operation of the electricity grid through the placement of FACTS for developing countries has also been analysed; Pakistan being a developing country has been selected as a case study. The planning problem has been solved for the present as well as for the forecasted power system. Consequently, in the current national network, 6.21\% and 6.71\% reduction in active and reactive power losses have been observed, respectively. Moreover, voltage profiles have been improved significantly. A detailed financial analysis covering the calculation of Operation Cost (OC) of the national grid before and after the placement of FACTS devices is carried out.},

	abstract = {During major power system disturbances, when multiple component outages occur in rapid succession, it becomes crucial to quickly identify the transmission interconnections that have limited power transfer capability. Understanding the impact of an outage on these critical interconnections (called saturated cut-sets) is important for enhancing situational awareness and taking correct actions. This paper proposes a new graph theoretic approach for analyzing whether a contingency will create a saturated cut-set in a meshed power network. A novel feature of the proposed algorithm is that it lowers the solution time significantly making the approach viable for real-time operations. It also indicates the minimum amount by which the power transfer through the critical interconnections should be reduced so that post-contingency saturation does not occur. Robustness of the proposed algorithm for enhanced situational awareness is demonstrated using the IEEE-118 bus system as well as a 17,000+ bus model of the Western Interconnection (WI). Comparisons made with different approaches for power system vulnerability assessment prove the utility of the proposed scheme for aiding power system operations during extreme exigencies.},

The design methodology uses a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based mixed H2/Hâˆž robust control for multiple operating scenarios. To reduce the high computational burden, an enhanced version of selective modal analysis (SMA) is employed that not only reduces the number of required wide-area feedback signals, but also identifies alternate feedback signals, in case of failure of the primary signals. Additionally, the impact of delays on the performance of the control design is investigated.

	abstract = {Electrification of the transportation sector can play a vital role in reshaping smart cities. With an increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on the road, deployment of well-planned and efficient charging infrastructure is highly desirable. Unlike level 1 and level 2 charging stations, level 3 chargers are super-fast in charging EVs. However, their installation at every possible site is not techno-economically justifiable because level 3 chargers may cause violation of critical system parameters due to their high power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate an optimized combination of all three types of EV chargers for efficiently managing the EV load while minimizing installation cost, losses, and distribution transformer loading. Effects of photovoltaic (PV) generation are also incorporated in the analysis. Due to the uncertain nature of vehicle users, EV load is modeled as a stochastic process. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to solve the constrained nonlinear stochastic problem. MATLAB and OpenDSS are used to simulate the model. The proposed idea is validated on the real distribution system of the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) Pakistan. Results show that an optimized combination of chargers placed at judicious locations can greatly reduce cost from \$3.55 million to \$1.99 million, daily losses from 787kWh to 286kWh and distribution transformer congestion from 58\% to 22\% when compared to scenario of optimized placement of level 3 chargers for 20\% penetration level in commercial feeders. In residential feeder, these statistics are improved from \$2.52 to \$0.81 million, from 2167kWh to 398kWh and from 106\% to 14\%, respectively. It is also realized that the integration of PV improves voltage profile and reduces the negative impact of EV load. Our optimization model can work for commercial areas such as offices, university campuses, and industries as well as residential colonies.},

	abstract = {Bilateral transactions hedge both sides against uncertain price and volume risks of day-ahead auction and make up major portions of trading in electricity markets. Peer-to-peer bilateral transactions avoid broker fees but involve challenges of balancing between cooperative and competitive strategies for multi-round negotiations. To solve these challenges, this paper develops novel utility-based and adaptive agent-tracking strategies for bilateral negotiations. Relying on bilateral transaction volume and utility curves determined over a price range during unilateral pre-negotiation, utility-based strategies are developed for generation company (GenCo) agent (load serving entity (LSE) agent) to offer (bid) volumes and prices during multi-round bilateral negotiations. GenCo agent is also equipped with a new adaptive agent-tracking strategy that estimates reservation price of each LSE agent by Bayesian learning and updates the estimates in each round. The adaptive agent-tracking strategy facilitates cooperative yet competitive responses. Integration of new bilateral negotiation strategies with existing day-ahead auction in a renowned agent-based platform also enables combined simulation of the two market types. The case study demonstrates that the adaptive agent-tracking strategy empowers GenCoagents to swing bilateral negotiation results in their favor and yield 7\% more payoff than the utility-based strategy, while achieving 100\% improvement in frequency of failure of negotiation.},

Two BESS technologies that have gained prominence in this regard are Lithium-ion (LI) BESS and Vanadium redox flow (VRF) BESS.

	abstract = {Matchmaking and bilateral negotiations are two distinct phases of practical market participantsâ€™ decision making for bilateral transactions. Agent-based models are naturally suitable for electricity markets in general and bilateral transactions in particular. This paper's contribution includes development of a novel matchmaking model that generates forward contracting power and utility curves. The matchmaking model enables a load serving entity agent to undertake its own matchmaking, to find optimal trading allocations over a range of prices, before engaging in bilateral negotiations with generation company agents. Open-source agent-based simulation platform allows combined simulation of bilateral transactions and day-ahead auction. In this research paper, matchmaking is achieved by direct-search without any organized bulletin board, broker, or matchmaker. Instead of random matchmaking, portfolio optimization based matchmaking systematically explores available electricity trading options throughout the market: local and non-local bilateral trades as well as day-ahead auctions. The matchmaking algorithm is unique because it scans all trading options over the entire range of negotiable prices. Depending on private profit-seeking goals, risk-aversion preferences and market price statistics, each load serving entity agent individually finds its matchmaking results. A set of case studies demonstrates how matchmaking model depends on transmission rights and performs for different risk aversion factors.},

The proposed damping control strategy utilises the mixed H 2/H âˆž control with regional pole placement to suppress the oscillations. For ensuring applicability over a wider operating range, the convex polytopic theory is utilised by using different operating points as the vertices of a convex polytope. The centralised, coordinated controller for damping SSOs is designed using linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, unmeasurable state variables, if present, are represented by corresponding output variables. The damping signal is implemented as active power and reactive power modulation of the rotor-side converter of the doubly fed induction generators. A 4-machine, 2-area system and a 39-machine New England system are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control. The simulation results show that the polytopic controller can not only provide requisite damping to the SSO modes of interest, but also has good control performance when the wind power outputs change over a wide range.},

	abstract = {With the growth of renewable generation (RG) and the development of associated ride through curves serving as operating limits, during disturbances, on violation of these limits, the power system is at risk of losing large amounts of generation. In order to identify preventive control measures that avoid such scenarios from manifesting, the power system must be modeled as a constrained dynamical system. For such systems, the interplay of feasibility region (man-made limits) and stability region (natural dynamical system response) results in a positively invariant region in state space known as the constrained stability region (CSR). After the occurrence of a disturbance, as it is desirable for the system trajectory to lie within the CSR, critical clearing time (CCT) must be defined with respect to the CSR instead of the stability region as is done traditionally. The sensitivity of CCT to system parameters of constrained systems then becomes beneficial for planning/revising protection settings (which impact feasible region) and/or operation (which impact dynamics). In this paper, we derive the first order CCT sensitivity of generic constrained power systems using the efficient power system trajectory sensitivity computation, pioneered by Hiskens and Pai in [â€œTrajectory sensitivity analysis of hybrid systems,â€ IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. Fundam. Theory Appl., vol. 47, no. 2, pp. 204-220, Feb. 2000].

	abstract = {Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) play an important role in minimizing power losses and voltage deviations while increasing the real power transfer capacity of transmission lines. The extent to which these devices can provide benefits to the transmission network depend on their optimal location and sizing. However, finding appropriate locations and sizes of these devices in an electrical network is difficult since it is a nonlinear problem. This paper proposes a technique for the optimal placement and sizing of FACTS, namely the Thyristor-Controlled Series Compensators (TCSCs), Shunt VARs Compensators (SVCs), and Unified Power Flows Controllers (UPFCs). To find the optimal locations of these devices in a network, weak buses and lines are determined by constructing PV curves of load buses, and through the line stability index. Then, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is employed not only to find an ideal ratings for these devices but also the optimal coordination of SVC, TCSC, and UPFC with the reactive power sources already present in the network (tap settings of transformers and reactive power from generators). The objective here is the minimization of the operating cost of the system that consists of active power losses and FACTS devices cost. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 14 and 30 bus systems. The presented technique is also compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The findings showed that total system operating costs and transmission line losses were considerably reduced by WOA as compared to existing metaheuristic optimization techniques.},

These RGs have ride through curves programmed in them which define operating conditions that need to be satisfied during electrical disturbances. If they are violated, the RGs are tripped offline. In systems with large amounts of RGs tightly coupled electrically, there can be disturbances that cause sudden loss of a large number of RGs, which will then considerably exacerbate the stability of the system. Such a phenomenon is not captured by the existing direct methods for TSA. In this paper, by treating RG-rich systems as non-linear switched systems as opposed to the traditional approach of treating this tripping phenomenon as an instability, an approach utilizing multiple low voltage ride through constrained stability regions (CSRs) is proposed for capturing unstable fault clearing times. The CSRs are estimated through Lyapunov functions found using sum of squares programming. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated using a three-machine system.},

This number is steadily increasing, posing a challenge to energy regulators as well as suppliers. To manage the growing demand for energy, there is a need for energy system optimization, especially on the demand side. This paper uses a first principles approach to build a high-resolution energy demand model, which can be used as a test bed by academicians as well as policy makers for performing such optimizations. This framework generates activity-based, building-level, time-dependent demand profiles. The model associates appliance usage with each household activity and calculates energy consumption based on the appliance energy rating, the duration of the energy consuming activity, and the type of activity performed by each household member. It also accounts for shared activities among household members to avoid double counting. Additionally, passive energy consumptions such as space heating/cooling, lighting, etc., are measured. Finally, validation of the results obtained by this model against real-world data for Virginia is carried out. The results indicate that the modeling framework is robust and can be extended to other parts of the U.S. and beyond.},

Due to improvements in relay technology, digital relays can now serve as both relays and PMUs. Under such circumstances, the substation installations consume the largest portion of the deployment cost, and not the devices themselves.

The pre-fault state consists of a variety of operating conditions and loading angles of faulted lines. The fault condition comprises different fault types, fault locations, fault impedances, and fault incidence angles. Fault classification is done using MATLABÂ® (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA).The approach is successfully tested on the IEEE-118 bus system.

	abstract = {Traditional methods for predicting transient stability of power systems such as the direct method, the time domain approach, and the energy function methods, do not work well for real-time stability predictions. The use of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) appears to alleviate this problem by providing information in real-time for transient stability assessment and enhancement. Techniques such as the rotor oscillation prediction method based on time series have made the prediction of system stability possible for real-time applications. However, such methods often require more than 300ms after the start of a transient event to make reliable predictions. This paper proposes using the trajectory of the apparent impedance recorded by PMUs placed at strategic locations in the power system to rapidly predict transient stability. From the simulations performed, it is realized that system stability can be predicted in approximately 200ms (12cycles). The main advantage of this method is its simplicity as the PMUs can record the apparent impedance trajectories in real-time without any previous calculation. Moreover, using decision trees built in CARTÂ®, transient stability prediction becomes straightforward and computationally very fast. The optimum locations for PMU placement can also be determined using this technique.},

	abstract = {Classification and regression trees (CART) has been used for various applications in power systems. In most of these applications, phasor data obtained from phasor measurement units are used for building the decision tree. However, the splits in CART are based on a single attribute or a combination of variables chosen by CART itself rather than the user. But as phasor measurement unit data are complex numbers, both the attributesâ€”real and imaginaryâ€”should be considered simultaneously for making critical decisions. For example, changing the reference bus in situations where the split is only on the real or imaginary part of a complex voltage (or current) measurement can cause the performance of the tree to degrade significantly. An algorithm is proposed in this article to allow splits on complex synchrophasor data. The methodology is implemented on two systems: a detailed model of the California Power System, where it is used for developing an adaptive protection scheme, and the IEEE 118-bus system, where it is used to classify dynamic events based on trajectories of voltage measurements obtained from phasor measurement units.

The proposed technique is initially applied to an equivalent model of the WECC system developed in MATLAB and then transferred to a larger and more detailed version created in PSLF. The controllers initially used for the design are the two HVDC lines and an SVC. Three ESDs are added to the model for the improvement of the control.

Initially, a data-driven approach for judicious measurement selection to facilitate reliable state estimation is provided. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to perform DSSE for systems that are incompletely observed by synchrophasor measurement devices (SMDs). Robustness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by considering realistic measurement error models for SMDs. A comparative study of the DNN-based DSSE with classical linear state estimation indicates that the DL-based approach gives better accuracy with a significantly smaller number of SMDs.},

The inductively powered recorder operates wirelessly by using the current flowing through a typical distribution conductor. The recorder is designed to be small, lightweight, and is intended to be installed directly on the power line. To validate the performance of this recorder, tests of measurement accuracy, electric current requirements, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference from both steady-state and arc-induced sources are performed.

	abstract = {Inverter based renewable generation (RG), especially at the distribution level, is supposed to trip offline during an islanding situation. However, islanding detection is done by comparing the voltage and frequency measurements at the point of common coupling (PCC), with limits defined in the form of ride-through curves. Current practice is to use the same limit throughout the year independent of the operating conditions. This could result in the tripping of RG at times when the system is already weak, thereby posing a threat to voltage security by heavily limiting the load margin (LM). Conversely, heavily relaxing these limits would result in scenarios where the generation does not go offline even during an islanding situation. The proposed methodology focuses on optimizing low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) settings at selective RGs as a preventive control for maintaining a desired steady-state voltage stability margin while not sacrificing dependability during islanding. The proposed process is a multi-stage approach, in which at each stage, a subset of estimated poor-quality solutions is screened out based on various sensitivities. A full continuation power flow (CPFLOW) is only run at the beginning and in the last stage on a handful of remaining candidate solutions, thereby cutting down heavily on the computation time. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 9-bus system.},

To overcome these challenges, this research develops a DSA scheme to provide security prediction in real-time for load profiles of different seasons in presence of realistic errors in the PMU measurements. The major contributions of this paper are: (1) develop a DSA scheme based on PMU data, (2) consider seasonal load profiles, (3) account for varying penetrations of renewable generation, and (4) compare the accuracy of different machine learning (ML) algorithms for DSA with and without erroneous measurements. The performance of this approach is tested on the IEEE-118 bus system. Comparative analysis of the accuracies of the ML algorithms under different operating scenarios highlights the importance of considering realistic errors and variability in system conditions while creating a DSA scheme.},

Prior blackouts have shown that failures in the power grid can cascade, starting from a single failure, leading to a large number of failed nodes. In this paper, we study the problem of identifying a set of k critical nodes, whose failure/attack leads to the maximum number of tripped nodes. There has been a lot of work on this problem, but it has been mainly restricted to simple networks and failure models with either steady state analysis or DC power flow. In this paper, we perform AC power flow based transient analysis on a detailed power grid model. We find that a simple greedy approach yields node sets with higher criticality than a degree based approach, which has been suggested in many prior works. Furthermore, we observe that the cascades exhibit a non-monotonic behavior as a function of k.},

Contrary to the traditional approach of modelling the stochasticity only in the initial conditions, the SDAE-based method (SDAEM) describes wind power variation as a continuous stochastic process. Next, the model of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) grid-connected power system is also expressed as a SDAE. Finally, the probabilistic small signal stability (PSSS) and the probabilistic transient stability (PTS) conditions are defined. A single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system and a 16-machine, 68-bus system are used as the test systems for this analysis. The results indicate that SDAEM is more accurate and reliable in describing the system conditions in presence of stochastic inputs, and thus can be used to decide the right course of controller action.},

The authors of this paper had previously developed a bottom-up approach for computing season-wise household-level residential energy consumption profiles using a synthetic population resource. In this paper, that model is enhanced to account for the effects that increasing percentages of rooftop solar penetration can have on the residential energy demand profiles of different regions. This information will be very useful to electric power utilities because it will help them efficiently manage the increasing numbers of residential rooftop solar installations in their supply areas.},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of transmission line parameters in general, and sequence impedances, in particular, plays an important role in state estimation, fault detection, and adjustment of relay settings. Line parameter estimation using online methods has attracted considerable interest with the widespread installation of phasor measurement units (PMUs). Although various methods have been proposed in the literature for line parameter estimation, most of them have been tested on purely synthetic datasets. A synthetic dataset does not capture the nuances of real data, such as measurement invariance and realistic field noise. Therefore, the algorithms developed using synthetic datasets may not be as effective when used in practice. In this paper, a three-stage test procedure is developed to compare the performance of two algorithms, namely, moving-window total least squares (MWTLS) recursive Kalman filter (RKF), on real PMU data. The results prove that RKF is better than MWTLS. This paper also proposes using ASPEN data as an initial estimate to RKF for further improving its performance. Finally, to circumvent the problems faced due to data dropouts, an auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is implemented to predict the variations in sequence impedances.},

With the continued addition of PMUs into the grid, classical LSE solvers would have to handle large sets of high-speed data. Furthermore, security threats in the form of false data injection (FDI) attacks must also be considered in the design, which will considerably add to the computational overhead of LSE solvers. Although installing additional computation and communication hardware is a possible solution, such a solution would incur substantial infrastructure and operation costs. In this paper, we explore the design of a cost-effective and scalable cloud hosted LSE (CLSE) solver that also has false data detection (FDD). The proposed CLSE-FDD application exploits GPU parallel processing capabilities for mitigating the performance overhead of FDD to match the operation speed of classical LSE solvers. Results indicate that the GPU based CLSE-FDD application can easily scale in excess of 1,500 PMU installations.},

In this work, we attempt to understand the consequences of cascade tripping mechanism through a Lyapunov approach. A conservative definition for the stability region (SR) along with its estimation for a given cascading sequence using sum of squares (SOS) programming is proposed. Finally, a simple probabilistic definition of the SR is used to visualize the risk of instability and understand the impact of blocking trip sequences.

When trying to estimate this region using Lyapunov functions, the shape of the final estimate is often limited by the degree of the function chosen - a limitation that results in conservativeness in the estimate of the SR. More conservative the estimate is in a particular region in state space, smaller is the estimate of the critical clearing time (CCT) for disturbances that drive the system towards that region. In order to reduce this conservativeness, we propose a methodology that uses the disturbance trajectory data to skew the shape of the final Lyapunov-based SR estimate. We exploit the advances made in the theory of sum of squares decomposition to algorithmically estimate this region. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated on a power systems classical model.},

Our formulation explicitly incorporates urban activity patterns, and considers multiple types of charging stations. We show that EVChargingStation is NP-hard, in general, and present approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees. We evaluate one of our algorithms using a detailed urban activity model for the city of Portland, OR. Our results show a tradeoff between the number of charging stations and the maximum service distance, thus providing a systematic methodology for urban planners to evaluate policies for increasing EV deployment. We also show that considering such activity patterns is necessary, in the sense that deploying charging stations at "high traffic" locations can lead to significantly worse solutions.},

	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6965460},
	abstract = {This paper proposes two metrics for assessing static and dynamic stresses present in a large interconnected power grid. The base loading of the system constitutes the static stress. It refers to the normal/pre-contingency state of the system. The dynamic stress refers to the event/contingency that the system is subjected to and is primarily caused by loss of transmission system or drop in generation. The angle difference between buses located across the network, and the voltage sensitivity of buses lying in the middle are two synchrophasor-based metrics that are found to accurately reflect the system's static loading and its ability to withstand the dynamic stress. The simulations performed using the full WECC system show that by monitoring these metrics in real-time, the ability of the system to withstand a variety of contingencies can be predicted with great accuracy. These metrics can be monitored through analytic and visualization platforms such as RTDMSÂ®1, which is a synchrophasor based software application. The methodology to be followed for integrating with such a platform is also provided. The analysis shows that the proposed metrics can be very effective in aiding system operators for real-time static and dynamic stress monitoring.},

	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6184591},
	abstract = {In order to reduce the detrimental effects of inter-area oscillations on system stability, it is possible to use Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) to design a multi-objective state feedback control. The LMI optimization comes up with a control law that stabilizes numerous operating conditions simultaneously using a polytopic model of the system. However, the number of cases to be considered is limited by computational complexity and increased chances of infeasibility. In order to circumvent this problem, this paper presents a method for solving multiple polytopic problems having a common base case. The proposed algorithm determines which polytopic control is necessary for a particular contingency and classifies them as belonging to that polytopic domain. The technique was tested on an 8-machine, 13 bus system and provided satisfactory results.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic state prediction method based on an Auto-Regressive Model (AR model) using PMU data. In recent years, state prediction has played a key role in improving power system performance and reliability. When load is increased linearly at a constant power factor, it is proved in this paper that the bus voltages are quadratic and the AR model for predicting the next voltage is based on three prior estimates. This logic is then tested on the IEEE-118 bus system. The test results demonstrate that under morning load pick-up, economic dispatch, line opening and generator oscillations, the proposed method is correct and gives valid predictions. Furthermore, based on the error in quadratic fit, it is advocated that this method could be applied to detect abnormal conditions in the transmission systems. Theoretical analysis and results show that the proposed method based on AR model has great potential in predicting power system states.},

In conjunction with a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) formulation and a polytopic model a single control law can be found to guarantee pole placement for multiple contingencies. The previous attempts have used a model containing all the Îµ and Ï‰ modes, with SMA used to eliminate all other states. In practical applications the resulting system is still too large to use in a polytopic model. This paper presents an algorithm to further reduce the system size to the relevant modes of oscillations. A 16 machine, 68 bus system is used as the test case with PSSs, DC lines and SVCs acting as the control.},

	abstract = {The Central American Power System (CAPS) comprises of the electrical power networks of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The topology of the network, the geographical distribution of the load and generation blocks, and the localized weaknesses in some sections of the transmission grid have made this system prone to frequent partial or total blackouts. At the same time, this area has the advantage of having a control center that can promote international measures in order to safeguard the integrity of the transmission network. This paper presents a gradual optimal PMU placement approach that guarantees minimum regional observability at the initial stage and full observability for the complete implementation. The paper also states how WAMS can provide real-time information to the control center for a more secure operation of the system. The practical constraints of ensuring real-time monitoring of critical buses of the network are taken into account during PMU Placement.},

	abstract = {High voltage power transformers are one of the most critical equipments in the electric power grid. A sudden failure of a power transformer can significantly disrupt bulk power delivery. Before a transformer reaches its critical failure state, there are indicators which, if monitored periodically, can alert an operator that the transformer is heading towards a failure. One of the indicators is the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the voltage and current signals in substations located in the vicinity of the transformer. During normal operations, the width of the SNR band is small. However, when the transformer heads towards a failure, the widths of the bands increase, reaching their maximum just before the failure actually occurs. This change in width of the SNR can be observed by sensors, such as phasor measurement units (PMUs) located nearby. Identifying Code is a mathematical tool that enables one to uniquely identify one or more objects of interest, by generating a unique signature corresponding to those objects, which can then be detected by a sensor. In this paper, we first describe how Identifying Code can be utilized for detecting failure of power transformers. Then, we apply this technique to determine the fewest number of sensors needed to uniquely identify failing transformers in different test systems.},

We briefly discuss the geographical location of the blast and the interconnection of the power utility serving this area, with the neighboring power utilities. Analysis of the grid with respect to steady state stability as well as transient stability is performed to understand the impact of loss in load as a result of the blast. The steady state analysis alone does not offer a complete understanding of the loss of the neighboring substations. The transient stability analysis shows that for the simulated event, the system stabilizes approximately 7 s after the occurrence of the event. The stability of the system can be attributed to the fact that the drop in load was relatively small compared to the generation capacity of the EI.},
